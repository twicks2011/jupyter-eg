    "Jupyter Book uses an extended set of commands to standard Markdown. This extension is called MyST (Markedly Structured Text) and has some rather nice features. Unfortunately, they can only be seen in the final book and can look slighty ungainly in the Notebook itself. A MyST cheat sheet can be found [here](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/reference/cheatsheet.html), but below are some of the more useful features."
